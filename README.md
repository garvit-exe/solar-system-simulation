## Introduction
This project is a basic solar system simulation created using Python and Pygame. It visualizes the orbits of planets around the sun, taking into account gravitational forces and realistic initial velocities.

## Features
- Simulation of planets orbiting the sun.
- Realistic gravitational forces between celestial bodies.
- Visualization of planet orbits.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-system-simulation.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd solar-system-simulation

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame

## Usage
1. Run the simulation script:

   ```bash
   python solar_system_simulation.py

2. The simulation window will open, displaying the solar system. Close the window to exit the simulation.

## Customization
You can customize the simulation by adjusting parameters such as initial velocities, colors, and more. Explore the AstralBody class in the solar_system_simulation.py file to make changes.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to enhance the project.
